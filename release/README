These are files and utilities used by the modencode staff to
manage cloud releases.


Procedure for Creating New Data Volumes  
---------------------------------------

N) Snapshot each data volume using the following description format:

     modENCODE S. SSSSSSS TTT data, part X (DD MMMMM YYYYY)

  where S. SSSSSSS is the species (e.g. D. melanogaster)
               TTT is the data type, one of "raw", "interpreted" or "signal"
                DD is the data release day
            MMMMMM is the data release month
              YYYY is the data release year

 There is a script named "create_new_data_volume_snapshots.pl" in 
 /modencode/release/util that will help you do this. The volumes
 must previously be mounted using correct naming system "cele-raw-4"
 and you must change the hard-coded release date constant at the
 top of the script.

Procedure for Creating & Attaching New Data Snapshots to Data Image
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Initiate a COPY of the data image using a recent AMI.

2) Mount the new data volumes
