The modencode image uses a patched version of vsftpd which shows the
targets of symbolic links in all listings rather than the symbolic link
itself. This is to make it easier for users to see the sizes of the
files before they download them.

The patch consists of the following:

--- vsftpd-2.3.0~pre2/ls.c	2011-09-29 16:45:42.262348906 +0000
+++ vsftpd-2.3.0~pre2/ls.c.new	2011-09-29 16:45:17.112345793 +0000
